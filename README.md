**I'm Leon, although most people call me Lemon**.

I'm a full-stack engineer who has been writing code for about 12 years. In my day-to-day, I work with Python, Terraform, AWS, Angular, React and PostgreSQL a lot. Right now I'm learning **Kubernetes** üßä.

I work for a wonderful ‚öïÔ∏è healthtech ‚öïÔ∏è company called [Dignio](https://dignio.com), where I help create software that governments and hospitals use to provide remote care for patients. I honestly believe we're part of something important, and I sleep a little better at night knowing I work for the good guys.

I'm also the owner of a huge Python learning community called [Python Discord](https://pythondiscord.com). With a staff of nearly 100 humans, and over 100,000 members in total, it's no small task to keep it operating, but it's where I've met some of my closest friends and where I've learned half of everything I know. If you like Python, [you should come check us out](https://discord.gg/python)!

My website is a toy. Remember to **touch my face!**
